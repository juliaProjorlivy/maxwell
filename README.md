# Maxwell Distribution Analysis
This project was made to study particle collisions and their Maxwell Distribution.
Starting to move at the same speed in a random directions, the particles
should come to a Maxwell velocity Distribution after some time. 
So the aim is to calculate that time, considering starting conditions (velocity, 
number of particles, Distribution density).

## Theory

## Installation
#### Requirements
Some libraries: [mathGL](https://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Main.html), [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html), my own error managing lib that is already
in code as a submodule (you can make it static or dynamic).
